# password-generator
This homework assignment required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. When generate password button is pressed, the user is prompted with criteria for their desired password. The prompts include desired character length (between 8 and 128 characters), include lowercase and/or uppercase characters, numerical characters, and/or special characters. After prompts are completed, a random password is generated based off of the selected criteria from user.
